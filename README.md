# MVVM Tools
This is a simple collection of protocols and utilities for making MVVM easier
with Swift. It is intentionally lightweight and fairly opinionated. It's
intended to be used alongside [Bond](https://github.com/SwiftBond/Bond).

## Getting started
This framework can be added to you project easily using Carthage:

```
github "dhardiman/MVVMTools"
```

The framework has Bond as a dependency, which will be brought in with Carthage
as well.
